# Introduction to AI Tools
This workshop will provide an introduction to the basics of what an AI (Artificial Intelligence) is and what common uses AI has today.  The session will be broken up into two parts:

- A slideshow and discussion section where we will discuss AI
- A "play" section where we will explore some popular free online AI tools like chatGPT and Dream.ai.


No prior experience with this topic is needed for this workshop.

*Estimated length of workshop: 1.5 hours*

## Setup Instructions
In preparation for this workshop you may optionally create accounts on any of the tools below that you might want to try during the play portion of the session.  This can also be done during the session.

- [OpenAI/ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
- [Dream.ai](https://dream.ai/)
- [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) 
- [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)

## Common AI Terms

- **Algorithm** - A set of commands or rules that must be followed for a computer to perform calculations or other problem-solving operations.  This can be as simple as a decision tree (like a flowchart) or as complex as a set of instructions of computers on how to parse and learn from data.
- **Artificial Intelligence** - The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.
- **Computer Vision** - Computer Vision refers to methods by which computers can recognize, analyze, and produce descriptions of digital images.
- **Data** - Data is information that is used for analysis or decision making. (Big Data, Training Data)
  - **Big Data** - Big Data is a term used for large or complex datasets that are too large to analyze or process via traditional means.  This type of data is also often continually growing, adding to the complexity of working with it.
  - **Training Data** -  Training Data is any data that is used to train a machine learning model or an algorithm.  The type, quantity, and quality of the training data determines what outputs the model or algorithm will be capable of producing. 
- **Generative AI**
- **Large Language Model** (LLM)
- **Machine Learning** - A type of AI focused on algorithms that allow computers to learn from data to the point that they can make assumptions or "generalizations".  This allows computers to perform more complex tasks without explicit instructions or data.
  - **Deep Learning** - Deep Learning is a method of Machine Learning focused on identifying complex patterns from multiple data sources to train neural networks, make predictions, and identify trends across all data sources.
  - **Neural Network** - Neural Networks are a type of Machine Learning modeled after the human brain.  This method focuses on creating nodes with pathways connecting them to create vast networks of interconnected data allowing for "intelligent" decision making. 
- **Natural Language Processing**
- 
- **Sentiment Analysis** (Opinion Mining)
- **Token** (Tokenization)

## Next Steps
Now that you have a basic understanding of AI and the tools that use it, the next step is to explore a variety of options to discover what tools will best support you in what you want to do.  Some places that you can start are listed below!
