# Introduction to AI Tools
This workshop will provide an introduction to the basics of what an AI (Artificial Intelligence) is and what common uses AI has today.  The session will be broken up into two parts:

- A slideshow and discussion section where we will discuss AI
- A "play" section where we will explore some popular free online AI tools like chatGPT and Dream.ai.


No prior experience with this topic is needed for this workshop.

*Estimated length of workshop: 1.5 hours*
